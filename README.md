## ROS-Unity Setup
```
This is using unity_robotics_demo under the ROS–Unity Integration tutorials, use this as a template to generate different message types
```
1. Open Package Manager and click the + button at the top left corner. Select "add package from git URL" and enter `https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.ros-tcp-connector` to install the ROS-TCP-Connector package.
2. In the Unity menu bar, go to `Robotics -> Generate ROS Messages`.... In the `ROS Message Browser` window, click the `Browse` button at the top right to set the ROS message path to `tutorials/ros_unity_integration/ros_packages/unity_robotics_demo_msgs` in this repo. **(This applies to any message types)**
3. In the message browser, expand the `unity_robotics_demo_msgs subfolder` and click `Build 2 msgs` and `Build 2 srvs` to generate C# scripts from the ROS .msg and .srv files.

- Current message types already include `MAVROS`, `GEOMETRIC`, `GEOGRAPHIC`, `SENSOR` and `STD`.
